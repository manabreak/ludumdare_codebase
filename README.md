LibGDX Ludum Dare setup / codebase
==================================

Here's the codebase I use for Ludum Dare 48h compo. The first time I use(d) this is LD30.

Feel free to use and modify this "template" as you wish. The template is MIT-licensed, so go bonkers - you don't have to share your modifications (although I appreciate if you do!).

The template doesn't do much in terms of gameplay - actually, it does nothing. Instead, it focuses on streamlining the resource management and the scene2d creation. The template automatically generates texture atlases from individual image files placed inside "./images" folder. There's also empty classes for menu and game scenes, and an "Entity" class which combines both scene2D actor and sprites.
